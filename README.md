The purpose of this site is to share some resources I have found helpful for learning how to do data sciences.  It includes some books, some excellent repositories, and some pieces I've written to help my understanding (in the spirit of "if you can't explain it you don't understand it"). 

## Doing Data Science

#### Python
I started my data sciences journey with R and SAS, but its all about Python now. I like:
* Introduction To Computer Science with Python <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7" rel="nofollow"> MITs EdX course</a>
* Python for Data Analysis, by Wes McKinney <a href="https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book/" rel="nofollow"> book and code repository</a>
* Python Data Science Handbook, by Jake VanderPlas <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/" rel="nofollow"> book and code repository</a>

#### Machine Learning
For a deeper understanding of what is going on under the hood, I like: 
* The book <a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a> is just excellent. Clear explanations of how ML algorithms work and practical examples. 
* The excellent Introduction to Statistical Learning has examples in R, but this <a href="https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python" rel="nofollow">Statstical Learning in Python</a> repository has done the labs and exercises in Python.
* Some articles I've written:
    * <a href="https://mattconners.github.io/RegressionusingMatrixAlgebra"> How Regression Works- Using Matrix Algebra </a> - a Python notebook with a step-by-step explanation of how regression works, explained using Matrix Algebra.
    * How K-means Clustering Works  - in progress
    * How Decision Tree Classification works - in progress
    * How Random Forest Regression Works - in progress
