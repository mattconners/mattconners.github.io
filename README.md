Passionate about finance, statistics, and machine learning. Over 20 years at Microsoft. Ski instructor on weekends.

The purpose of this site is to share what I have found helpful for learning how to do data sciences.  It includes excellent repositories I've forked, and some pieces created myself. 

### Doing Data Science

#### Python
No question that Python is eating the world. I started with R and SAS, but its all about Python now. I like:
Introduction To Computer Science with Pyton, MIT's Edx course.
* [Introduction To Computer Science with Pyton](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)
* [Python for Data Analysis, by Wes McKinney](https://github.com/mattconners/pydata-book)
* [Python Data Science Handbook, by Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)


#### Machine Learning
The Python books above show you how to use Python, Sci-kit and other libraries to do machine learning. However, to understand a couple of levels deeper

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning - this book is exceptionally well written and accessible](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)
* [Since Introduction to Statistical Learning is taught with R examples, check out this repository that has redone the labs and exercises in Python](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python)

* [How Regression Works, Using Matrix Algebra - Python notebook with my explanation of how regression works, explained using Matrix Algebra ](https://github.com/mattconners/mattconners.github.io/blob/master/regression.html)
