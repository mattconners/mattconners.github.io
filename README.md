The purpose of this site is to share what I have found helpful for learning how to do data sciences.  It includes excellent repositories I've forked, and some pieces created myself. 

### Doing Data Science

#### Python
No question that Python is eating the world. I started with R and SAS, but its all about Python now. I like:
* Introduction To Computer Science with Python <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7" rel="nofollow"> MITs EdX course</a>
* Python for Data Analysis, by Wes McKinney <a href="https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book/" rel="nofollow"> book and code repository</a>
* Python Data Science Handbook, by Jake VanderPlas <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/" rel="nofollow"> book and code repository</a>


#### Machine Learning
The Python resources above show you how to use Python, Sci-kit and other libraries to do machine learning. However, for a deeper understanding of what is going on under the hood, I like: 
* The book <a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a> has a nice balance between practical knowledge and a deeper understanding of the theory. Just the right level for me and the language is very clear. Note, labs and exercises are in R.
* The excellent Introduction to Statistical Learning is taught using R, but this <a href="https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python" rel="nofollow">Statstical Learning in Python</a> repository has the labs and exercises completed in Python.
* [gh-pages How Regression Works, Using Matrix Algebra - Python notebook with my explanation of how regression works, explained using Matrix Algebra ](https://github.com/mattconners/mattconners.github.io/blob/gh-pages/RegressionusingMatrixAlgebra.html)
* [master How Regression Works, Using Matrix Algebra - Python notebook with my explanation of how regression works, explained using Matrix Algebra ](https://github.com/mattconners/mattconners.github.io/blob/master/RegressionusingMatrixAlgebra.html)
