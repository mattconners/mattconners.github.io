The purpose of this site is to share some resources I have found helpful for learning how to do data sciences.  It includes some books, some excellent repositories, and some pieces I've written to help my understanding (in the spirit of "if you can't explain it you don't understand it). 

## Doing Data Science

#### Python
Python is the language I have focused on recently. I started my data sciences journey with R and SAS, but its all about Python now. I like:
* Introduction To Computer Science with Python <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7" rel="nofollow"> MITs EdX course</a>
* Python for Data Analysis, by Wes McKinney <a href="https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book/" rel="nofollow"> book and code repository</a>
* Python Data Science Handbook, by Jake VanderPlas <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/" rel="nofollow"> book and code repository</a>

#### Machine Learning
For a deeper understanding of what is going on under the hood, I like: 
* The book <a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a> has a nice balance between practical knowledge and a deeper understanding of the theory. Just the right level for me and the language is very clear. Note, labs and exercises are in R.
* The excellent Introduction to Statistical Learning is taught using R, but this <a href="https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python" rel="nofollow">Statstical Learning in Python</a> repository has done the labs and exercises in Python.
* My description of <a href="https://github.com/mattconners/mattconners.github.io/blob/gh-pages/RegressionusingMatrixAlgebra.html"> How Regression Works- Using Matrix Algebra </a> - a Python notebook with a step-by-step explanation of how regression works, explained using Matrix Algebra.
